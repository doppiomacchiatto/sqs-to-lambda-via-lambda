Description: |
  Creates a Lambda function that invokes other Lambda functions with
  SQS events.

Parameters:
  QueueToFunctionMapping:
    Description: |
      The list of SQS queue URLs and corresponding Lambda function
      names. Separate queue urls, function names, and pairs with commas:
      <queue_url_1>,<function_1>,<queue_url_2>,<function_2>.
      There must be an odd number of commas.
    Type: String

  Frequency:
    Description: |
      How often you want the specified SQS queues checked. If you choose
      "Continuous", a Lambda function will be constantly running, waiting for
      items in the queue. If you choose "1Minute", the Lambda function will
      only run every minute and check every queue. This can result in drastically
      reduced Lambda cost, at the expense of waiting up to a minute for items
      to become visibile in the queue before being processed by your functions.
    Type: String
    Default: Continuous
    AllowedValues:
      - Continuous
      - 1Minute

Outputs: {}

Conditions:
  Enable1MinutePoll: !Equals [!Ref Frequency, 1Minute]
  Enable5MinutePoll: !Equals [!Ref Frequency, Continuous]
